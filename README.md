retroweb-browser
================

This JavaScript framework allows you to easily develop content-rich, fully-interactive
websites that make use of JavaScript computer emulators to teach your visitors about
computer history.

The code presented here is the foundation of the
[RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum](http://retroweb.maclab.org).

This framework has been written generally enough that it may be modified for use by any
emulator that has been cross-compiled into JavaScript using the Emscripten toolchain.

The current release provides support for the PCE (http://www.hampa.ch/pce) and JSMESS
(http://jsmess.textfiles.com) collections of emulators.

## Highlights of this framework:

1. An easy-to-use icon-based interface for managing disk images
2. A documentation viewer that runs right next to the emulated computer
3. A Wiki-style markup for quick and simple development of content
4. Realistic photographic skins to lend realism to the emulated computers
5. Client-side JavaScript for easy hosting
6. Support for Google Analytics for tracking

## For developers
 
Several components have been packaged into WebComponentns for ready use by developers.
These components are available in the [RetroWeb Components](https://github.com/marciot/retroweb-components)
repository.
